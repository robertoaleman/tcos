The Challenge of Sequencing: Optimize task schedules based on earliest due date


This is a class that can optimize task schedules based on earliest due date.

It takes an array with values of tasks to be executed such as the time each task takes to execute and delivery time.

The class processes the tasks schedules to minimize the number of late tasks and displays several metrics about the scheduled tasks, such as the total flow time, average flow time, average delay time, backlog time, maximum delay, average time delay.

When you need to manage many concurrent tasks, you need to rearrange their schedules, so they can be completed as soon as possible and at the same time avoid that they run late considering the desired finishing time limit.

This class can perform the necessary calculations with a set of scheduled tasks minimizing the number of tasks that may run late.
